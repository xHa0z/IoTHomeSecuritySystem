#### What are they?
Yi Camera and 360 Camera are made by two different Chinese manufacture. Technically, these two products are only smart camera. They help house owners view their home remotely. These is no alarm feature in these two cameras.

Scout is more like a security system. It has a central hub to wireless connect its door panel, access sensor and motion sensor. A 106dB siren will be sound when the alarm is triggered. 

The main part of Canary and Cocoon is a high definition camera, plus some different kinds of sensors and a siren. And they need a power supply to keep the device working. 

August is a fingerprint-enabled door lock. You can use your fingerprint to lock and unlock the door. And you can use its app to check who enter your home at what time.
