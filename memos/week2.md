### Week 2
To: Dr. Jianjian Song

From: Zhihao Xue

Date: Sept 14, 2016


#### Summary of last meeting
* Talked about project proposal 
* Talked about current home security systems


#### Specific accomplishments for this week
* Complete a initial version of system block diagram
* Set up minimum requirements for test system
* Set up Intel Edison board
* Tried to run Ardunio sample on Edison, FAILED (See comments)
* Tried to establish SSH communication, succeeded once at home very beginning, but failed afterwards.

#### Specific goals for next week
* Tried to fix Arduino compiler error
* If not switch to another language
* Install web camera and try to openCV library on Edison

#### Additional comments
* The Arduino IDE gives me some compiler error when I tried to compile the sample code. I searched online, and it looks like this is not a common issue. Someone fixed this error by changing a file name. However, this caused some other errors. And there is one post said this error is due to operation system. If so, I am NOT going to switch operating system. Instead, I will try to switch to another language.
